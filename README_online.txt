Frequency Race — Ready to Publish
================================

This folder contains a polished, mobile-friendly web game for practicing adverbs of frequency.
Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

How to publish (two easy options):
1) Netlify Drop (no account required)
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag-and-drop the entire folder (all files) into the page
   - Netlify will publish a live URL instantly.

2) GitHub Pages
   - Create a new GitHub repository and upload these files (or push from git).
   - In the repo Settings -> Pages -> Set branch to 'main' and root to '/ (root)'
   - Save — the site will be live at https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/

Notes:
- The game is fully static (HTML/CSS/JS) — no server required.
- The text-to-speech (Speak prompts) uses the browser's built-in speechSynthesis API.
- You can edit the questions in script.js (the 'questions' array) to customize content for your students.
